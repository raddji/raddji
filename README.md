<h3> Hi, there! :wave:  I'm Raddi. </h3>

I'm a junior programmer and software developer, working on expanding my skills, knowledge and portfolio. 

A couple of projects I've worked on so far can be found at: 

https://memo-trip.herokuapp.com/ A digital memory scrapbook I'm working on in order to hone down my JavaScript, React, Expess, Node.js, Postgres SQL skills.

https://stormtides.org/ A data driven web application created in a two person collaborative team for the non-profit organization Center for Coastal Studies on Cape Cod, MA. It showcases storm tide pathways, flooding and inundation points, serving numerous communities. Currently being updated with React, Typescript and Leaflet-React.
