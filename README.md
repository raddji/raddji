### Hi, there! I'm Raddi. 

I'm a junior programmer and software developer, working on expanding my skills, knowledge and portfolio. 

A couple of projects I've worked on so far can be found at: 

https://java-sipped.herokuapp.com/ A collaborative group project completed at Launch Academy, Boston.

https://memo-trip.herokuapp.com/ A digital memory scrapbook I'm working on in order to hone down my JavaScript, React, Expess, Node.js, Postgres skills.

https://stormtides.org/ A web application created in a two person collaborative team for the non-profit organization Center for Coastal Studies on Cape Cod, MA. It showcases data on storm tide pathways, flooding and inundation, serving numerous communities.
