### Hi, there! I'm Raddi. 

I'm a junior programmer and software developer, working on expanding my portfolio and always learning new things. 
A couple of projects I've worked on so far can be found at: 

https://java-sipped.herokuapp.com/ A collaborative group project completed at Launch Academy, Boston.

http://memo-trip.herokuapp.com/ A digital memory scrapbook I'm working on in order to hone down my JavaScript, React, Expess, Node.js, Postgres skills.

Please, reach me at raddji@gmail.com
