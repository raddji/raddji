<h3> Hi, there! :wave:  I'm Raddi. </h3>

I'm a junior software developer, open and searching for my first full time position. 

A couple of projects I've worked on so far can be found at: 

https://java-sipped.herokuapp.com/ An application reviewing different businesses completed as part of a group.

https://memo-trip.herokuapp.com/ A digital memory scrapbook application that mainly uses JavaScript, React, Expess, Node.js, Postgres SQL.

https://stormtides.org/ A data driven web application created in a two person collaborative team for the non-profit organization Center for Coastal Studies on Cape Cod, MA. It showcases storm tide pathways, flooding and inundation points, serving numerous communities. Currently working on updating it with React, Typescript and Leaflet-React.
