<h3> Hi, there! :wave:  I'm Raddi. </h3>

I'm a junior software developer, open and searching for my first full time position. 

A couple of projects I've worked on so far can be found at: 

https://java-sipped.herokuapp.com/ A review application completed as a group project.

https://memo-trip.herokuapp.com/ A digital memory scrapbook.

https://stormtides.org/ A data driven web application for the non-profit organization Center for Coastal Studies on Cape Cod, MA.

You can reach me at **raddji at gmail** <br />
